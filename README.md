# CYCLOPS_Flux
Implementation of CYCLOPS using Flux

The Cyclic Ordering by Periodic Structure, or CYCLOPS, algorithm is a neural network, specifically, an autoencoder, with a circular bottle neck layer that takes advantage of the periodic structure that circadian rhythms create in gene expression data in order to determine an ordering for that data. This ordering enables analysis and study of circadian rhythms in data that is not time stamped.
